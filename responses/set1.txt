And the original text was

  I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell
  A rockin' on the mike while the fly girls yell
  In ecstasy in the back of me
  Well that's my DJ Deshay cuttin' all them Z's
  Hittin' hard and the girlies goin' crazy
  Vanilla's on the mike, man I'm not lazy.

  I'm lettin' my drug kick in
  It controls my mouth and I begin
  To just let it flow, let my concepts go
  My posse's to the side yellin', Go Vanilla Go!

  Smooth 'cause that's the way I will be
  And if you don't give a damn, then
  Why you starin' at me
  So get off 'cause I control the stage
  There's no dissin' allowed
  I'm in my own phase
  The girlies sa y they love me and that is ok
  And I can dance better than any kid n' play

  Stage 2 -- Yea the one ya' wanna listen to
  It's off my head so let the beat play through
  So I can funk it up and make it sound good
  1-2-3 Yo -- Knock on some wood
  For good luck, I like my rhymes atrocious
  Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious
  I'm an effect and that you can bet
  I can take a fly girl and make her wet.

  I'm like Samson -- Samson to Delilah
  There's no denyin', You can try to hang
  But you'll keep tryin' to get my style
  Over and over, practice makes perfect
  But not if you're a loafer.

  You'll get nowhere, no place, no time, no girls
  Soon -- Oh my God, homebody, you probably eat
  Spaghetti with a spoon! Come on and say it!

  VIP. Vanilla Ice yep, yep, I'm comin' hard like a rhino
  Intoxicating so you stagger like a wino
  So punks stop trying and girl stop cryin'
  Vanilla Ice is sellin' and you people are buyin'
  'Cause why the freaks are jockin' like Crazy Glue
  Movin' and groovin' trying to sing along
  All through the ghetto groovin' this here song
  Now you're amazed by the VIP posse.

  Steppin' so hard like a German Nazi
  Startled by the bases hittin' ground
  There's no trippin' on mine, I'm just gettin' down
  Sparkamatic, I'm hangin' tight like a fanatic
  You trapped me once and I thought that
  You might have it
  So step down and lend me your ear
  '89 in my time! You, '90 is my year.

  You're weakenin' fast, YO! and I can tell it
  Your body's gettin' hot, so, so I can smell it
  So don't be mad and don't be sad
  'Cause the lyrics belong to ICE, You can call me Dad
  You're pitchin' a fit, so step back and endure
  Let the witch doctor, Ice, do the dance to cure
  So come up close and don't be square
  You wanna battle me -- Anytime, anywhere

  You thought that I was weak, Boy, you're dead wrong
  So come on, everybody and sing this song

  Say -- Play that funky music Say, go white boy, go white boy go
  play that funky music Go white boy, go white boy, go
  Lay down and boogie and play that funky music till you die.

  Play that funky music Come on, Come on, let me hear
  Play that funky music white boy you say it, say it
  Play that funky music A little louder now
  Play that funky music, white boy Come on, Come on, Come on
  Play that funky music
